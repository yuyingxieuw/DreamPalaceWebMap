Anderson (1866/7-1927) was a leading African-American citizen and businessman in Lenoir's West End neighborhood. He was known primarily as a barber, but also ran a dry cleaners' shop as early as 1900.

At this time, his barbershop was located in the Commercial Hotel in downtown Lenoir. Barbering and laundry were relatively promising careers for young black men in the segregated turn-of-the-century South, but commercial existence was always threatened by the whims of the white majority. For example, in 1901, a J.R. Wilson came to Lenoir and openly advertised as the ""Only White Barber in Town"" (Lenoir Topic 10/30/1901, p. 2). How much business this might have taken away from Anderson is unknown; he did well enough, in any case, to take what was termed as ""an extended trip to northern cities"" in 1903 (Lenoir Topic 7/22/1903, p. 3). By 1906, he had expanded his commercial enterprise to include a small grocery store near his home in the West End, catering to the black community (Lenoir Weekly News 1/26/1906, p. 3). It was on the second floor of this building that, around 1913, he began showing silent films.

The Sanborn map from December 1913 lists Anderson's store in the West End as having a restaurant, barbershop (in addition to his shop for whites near the Courthouse downtown), and on the upper floor a ""MOTION PICTURE THEATRE."" The map is re-drawn with additional information here to give the location of Anderson's business.",,https://sites.google.com/appstate.edu/nwnc-theaters-2/caldwell/lenoir-west-end-theatre,Cross referenced 2 historical maps listed on the site and located approximate location of the theater on google map; the historical Oak street has been renamed to Willow and the current site is an empty lot.
